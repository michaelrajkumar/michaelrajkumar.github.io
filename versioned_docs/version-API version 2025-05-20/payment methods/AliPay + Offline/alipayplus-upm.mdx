Accept in-store payments from Alipay+ users through your point-of-sale system (POS) using the **Alipay+ User-Presented Mode Payment (B scan C)** payment method.

This guide walks you through the payment flow and details how to implement it.

## How to enable

**Supported Countries:** Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia  
**Minimum API version:** `2017-11-02`

| Supported Wallets | Thailand | Singapore | Malaysia |

To enable User-Presented Mode Payment (B scan C), send an email requesting this feature to [support@omise.co](mailto:support@omise.co). You will need to review and accept new terms and conditions.

## Payment flow

Customers paying via User-Presented Mode Payment (B scan C) present their payment code (barcode or QR code) to you. To create a charge, you must scan the payment code using a barcode reader.

![alipayplus-upm](/img/alipayplus-upm.png)

1️⃣ The customer opens an Alipay+ supported wallet on their mobile phone.  
2️⃣ Then, the customer generates a QR code in the wallet application and displays it to the merchant.  
3️⃣ The merchant scans the QR code with a QR code reader.  
4️⃣ The customer confirms payment in the wallet application.  
5️⃣ When the payment is successful, the wallet application will notify the customer.

## Implementation

Make the following API requests to create a charge using **User-Presented Mode Payment (B scan C).**

1. Create a new [charge](/charges-api#create) specifying the required parameters.
2. After receiving the charge completion webhook event, retrieve the charge to verify its status (optional, but recommended).

Use your **secret key** to create the User-Presented Mode Payment (B scan C) charge.

## Creating a charge

When the payer confirms they wish to use this payment method, create a [charge](/charges-api) specifying the following parameters: `amount`, `currency`, `source[type]` (alipayplus_upm), and `source[barcode]`.

| Parameter           | Type    | Description                                                              |
|---------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `amount`            | integer | (required) Amount in subunits of source currency                         |
| `currency`          | string  | (required) Currency for source as three-letter ISO 4217 code             |
| `source[type]`      | string  | (required) Payment source type `alipayplus_upm`                           |
| `source[barcode]`   | string  | (required) Payment code (barcode) number read by your scanner             |

The following example demonstrates how to create a charge using curl. Replace `$OMISE_SECRET_KEY` with the test secret key found on [your dashboard](https://sso-idp.omise.co/realms/engagement/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=dashboard&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.omise.co%2Fv2&state=105360ec-75e1-4633-84ce-37f575a481a9&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=bad19825-6662-494c-b3fa-c4f8cb8fb998&ui_locales=en&code_challenge=CzHJ3LuoY9_1i1l3AnT_kyyJV_UIkVKcWnjldQ4S49s&code_challenge_method=S256).

```bash
curl https://api.omise.co/charges \
  -u $OMISE_SECRET_KEY: \
  -d "amount=150000" \
  -d "currency=THB" \
  -d "source[type]=alipayplus_upm" \
  -d "source[barcode]=2897991359827699709"

## Setting the charge to expire

User-Presented Mode Payment (B scan C) charges that have not yet been authorized (`status=pending`) can be set to expire immediately, canceling the charge:

```bash
curl https://api.omise.co/charges/$CHARGE_ID/expire \
  -X POST \
  -u $OMISE_SECRET_KEY:
```
## Completing the charge

You have created a new charge with its `status` set to `pending`. Other possible values for charge `status` are `successful`, `failed`, and `expired`.

The following sections detail how to authorize a charge, receive its completion webhook event, and update its status.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant customer
    participant merchant
    participant api.omise.co
    participant payment provider

    customer->>merchant: Present payment code for scanning
    merchant->>api.omise.co: Create charge using payment code
    api.omise.co-->>merchant: Return charge   
    api.omise.co--x merchant: Send "charge.create" webhook
    customer->>payment provider: Provide charge authorization
    payment provider-->>customer: Return payment result
    payment provider-->>api.omise.co: Return payment result
    api.omise.co--x merchant: Send "charge.complete" webhook
```


### Receiving the charge completion event

The best way to be notified about charge completion is by using [webhook events](/api-webhooks).

Set up a location on the merchant server to receive webhook events and add this location as a webhook endpoint [on the dashboard](https://sso-idp.omise.co/realms/engagement/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=dashboard&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.omise.co%2Fv2&state=53075ccb-f9f2-48cd-86b1-5832abd511b8&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=b91aec0e-e4a0-4790-af76-e67a7bf86361&ui_locales=en&code_challenge=05XsRLkTZ9b149JDqFCsB3xXN3-_d9CGS_iCp0SLPy4&code_challenge_method=S256).

### Checking the charge status
After receiving this event, retrieve the charge using its `ID` and confirm that its `status` matches the `status` of the charge contained in the event.

 If the value of `status` is `successful`, you got paid.

 If the value of `status` is `failed`, check the `failure_code` and `failure_message` in the charge object for an explanation.

Possible failure codes are as follows:

| Failure Code            | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `payment_expired`        | Payment expired.                                                         |
| `payment_rejected`       | Payment rejected by the issuer.                                          |
| `insufficient_fund`      | Insufficient funds in the account or the payment method has reached its limit. |
| `failed_processing`      | General payment processing failure.                                      |

## Voids and refunds

You can void User-Presented Mode (B scan C) charges until 16:15 UTC on the transaction date and process partial or complete refunds within one year of the transaction.
