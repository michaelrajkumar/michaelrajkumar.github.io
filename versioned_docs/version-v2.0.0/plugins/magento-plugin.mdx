## Installation

Use [Composer](/getcomposer.org/) to install.

Run the following command in the same directory as your Magento installation:

```
composer require omise/omise-magento
```
If you are installing the module to an existing Magento installation, you may need to run the following commands after running composer:

```
php bin/magento module:enable Omise_Payment --clear-static-content
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

## Configuration

Connect your Omise account and enable your preferred payment methods. 
This enables your customers to make payments on your store through Omise.

In your Magento admin interface:

1. Go to `Stores` > `Configuration` > `Sales` > `Payment Methods`.
2. Configuration options are displayed under the **Omise** section.
3. Add your [test](https://sso-idp.omise.co/realms/engagement/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=dashboard&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.omise.co%2Fv2&state=6ec07f63-85db-4d93-be13-bb75ca934bee&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=d13c716a-29c6-4199-8650-4b1de413cbe5&ui_locales=en&code_challenge=4Doxs1FG_nf7vkAZxWvECjIlQ9r97Q0T5FA9Iijzx_M&code_challenge_method=S256) and [live](https://sso-idp.omise.co/realms/engagement/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=dashboard&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.omise.co%2Fv2&state=4c173f49-d4b4-48ba-95f4-13b70a21eaaa&response_mode=fragment&response_type=code&scope=openid&nonce=52d7109e-5bb9-4739-8ce0-67aaaa0d057a&ui_locales=en&code_challenge=NY8CciI7hPbFrW9G0IXNf_tIkQ8KODdO-VKUOEa4HS0&code_challenge_method=S256) keys and enable the module

> Note: If the setting for `Sandbox` is set to `Yes`, your **test** keys will be used. If the setting for
 `Sandbox` is set to `No`, your **live** keys for LIVE will be used.

## Enabling 3DS

If you would like to process 3DS (also known as *3-D Secure*) charges, please [contact support](mailto:support@omise.co?subject=Feature%20Request%3A%20Magento). to enable 3DS on your account.

> If the Omise team has enabled 3DS in the merchant's account, but the store has not activated
 the plugin yet, you may encounter difficulties receiving payment. You will receive a
  notification saying, “3d secure is requested, but return URI is not set”.

## Upgrading to the new secure form

To upgrade to the new secure form on Magento, use the following instructions:

Use **composer** to upgrade Magento.

Run the following command in the same directory as your existing Magento installation.

```
composer update omise/omise-magento
```

Then run the following commands to enable Omise:

```
php bin/magento module:enable Omise_Payment --clear-static-content
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

## Enabling the secure form for payments

```
Important: Any customizations that you made to the earlier card
 payment form are NOT retained when using the new secure form. You
  must redo the customizations for the secure form.
```

1. Select **Payment Settings** in the Settings screen.
2. Click **Configure** for Omise.
3. Expand **Enable Credit Card Payment** settings.
4. Set Secure Form to **Yes**.
5. (Optional) Select the theme (light or dark) for the secure form.  
   By default, the theme is set to Dark.

<div style={{ border: '1px solid #86a5f1', padding: '16px', backgroundColor: '#c4d2f5', color: '#215CEC', textAlign: 'center' }}>

  <p>To customize the form, click the link as highlighted.</p>

  <img 
    src="/img/form-custom-start-magento.png" 
    alt="Enable Credit Card Payment Settings" 
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} 
  />

  <p>Then, customize the form as desired.</p>
  <img 
    src="/img/form-customization-magento.png" 
    alt="Enable Credit Card Payment Settings" 
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} 
  />

    <p>Click Preview to preview the form.</p>
  <img 
    src="/img/form-preview-magento.png" 
    alt="Enable Credit Card Payment Settings" 
    style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }} 
  />
 <p>Click <strong>Save data</strong> to save the customized form.</p>

</div>

6. Click **Save Config.**  

```
Clear your browser's cache before using the new form.
```

Once set to **Yes**, the secure form is shown to customers who pay using card payments.

The secure form will soon be the default.  
We encourage all merchants to use it and provide feedback.
